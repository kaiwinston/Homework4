<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>For Image 1, I wanted to depict the epidemic of loneliness that we’ve been studying through my sociology class. In 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declared it a major public health crisis which has only worsened with time. I first went about representing this through the images diluted, dark, colorscape. I then used a backdrop of a gloomy Pennsylvania landscape I found in my saved photos (honestly not sure from where) and a figure I found via google to almost overexaggerate this feeling of dread that comes with isolation. The figure was actually too diluted to the point that they started blending in with the pavement so I did have to blend it through the “Darker Color” feature. Lastly, to finish it up, I added a quote from Jonotan Leandoer96’s Hotel in Minsk which touches on the topic. I also took elements from one of his separate albums depicting Dante’s Inferno, which I widened to the point of obscurity for aesthetic purposes.

In Image 2, I wanted to exhibit the youths' exposure to mass amounts of violence through videogames-- while also demonstrating my personal disdain for trophy hunting. I grew up playing games like Call of Duty (Which I do have to say, I still love) which completely reward the user for shedding more and more blood. While completely fictional to the eyes of an average adult, the line blurs when it comes to children. I added a killstreak medal from the game to depict this-- alongside the playstation trophies and controller to make my point clear. The backdrop is an image of a deer standing on its hind legs that I found on instagram which I thought made it look more human. The crosshair and the blood were also just found on Safari. My initial result with the blood looked notably fake and oversaturated so I made it slightly transparent and darkened it through the “Linear Burn” blending mode.
